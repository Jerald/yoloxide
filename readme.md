# Yoloxide

Yoloxide is a rust-based [Yolol](https://wiki.starbasegame.com/index.php/YOLOL) interpreter (and eventually emulator!) for the game [Starbase](https://www.starbasegame.com/).

## What's it do right now?

Currently it just tokenizes stuff! I'm pretty sure it exhaustively tokenizes yolol correctly, but I need some better tests to be sure.

If you want to try it for yourself, clone the repo, be sure you have rust installed, and run:
```
cargo run <yolol_file>
```
Replacing `<yolol_file>` with one of the test files in the repo, or one of your own.


## Where'd the name come from?

Things that are rusty are oxidized. So Yolol + oxide = Yoloxide!

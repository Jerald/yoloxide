# Yoloxide

Yoloxide is a rust-based [Yolol](https://wiki.starbasegame.com/index.php/YOLOL) interpreter engine for the game [Starbase](https://www.starbasegame.com/).

## What's it do right now?

It executes yolol code you give it! It's not particularly nice in the output (sorry for all the debug logs still in there!) but it does its job quite well, if I do say so myself.

If you want to try our Yoloxide for yourself, clone the repo, be sure you have rust installed, then run:
```
cargo run <yolol_file>
```
NOTE: As of August 2019 you need rust nightly.

Replacing `<yolol_file>` with one of the test files in the repo, or one of your own yolol scripts.

## Where'd the name come from?

Things that are rusty are oxidized. So Yolol + oxide = Yoloxide!
